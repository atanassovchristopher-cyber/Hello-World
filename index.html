My name is Chris, I am a 17 year old student at New Hope Solebury Highschool. I love to drive, play soccer and football, and spend time with people who understand me. I would like to become a successfull entreprenuer, and one of my main goals is to own my own exotic car autobody shop.
 HELLO World!!!
